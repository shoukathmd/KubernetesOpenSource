To use https://github.com/kubernetes/website repository, you need the following installed locally:

- npm
- Go
- Hugo (Extended version)
Installation :
git clone https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo.git
cd hugo
go install 

- A container runtime, like Docker.

git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
cd website

The Kubernetes website uses the Docsy Hugo theme. Even if you plan to run the website in a container, we strongly recommend pulling in the submodule and other development dependencies by running the following:

# pull in the Docsy submodule
git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1

Running the website using a container
make container-image
make container-serve
